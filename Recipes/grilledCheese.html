        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Indulge in the comforting delight of a perfectly crisp and gooey grilled cheese sandwich.
            Start with two slices of your favorite bread, buttered generously on the outside to achieve a golden, crunchy crust. 
            Inside, layer slices of rich, melty cheeseâ€”cheddar, American, or a blend for extra flavor and texture. 
            Heat a skillet over medium-low heat and cook the sandwich, pressing it lightly, 
            until both sides are beautifully browned and the cheese is irresistibly melted. 
            The result? A warm, cheesy, and satisfying treat that's ideal for any time of day.

        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of bread (your choice of the type!)</li>
            <li>2-3 slices of a mix cheese (a misex of cheddar, mozzerella, and parmesan cheese is recommended</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Spread butter evenly on one side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Place one slice of bread, buttered side down, on a clean surface.</li>
            <li>Layer the cheese slices on top of the bread. If using additional ingrediants such as tomato, add it on top of the cheese.</li>
            <li>Top with the second slice of bread, buttered side up.</li>
            <li>Place the assembled sandwich in the skillet. Cook for 2-4 minutes, or until the bottom is golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li>Carefully flip the sandwich and cook the other side for another 2-4 minutes, or until it's also golden brown and the cheese is melted.</li>
            <li>Remove the sandwich from the skillet and let it rest for a minute before cutting. This helps the cheese set slightly and makes it easier to cut.</li>
            <li>Cut in half and enjoy!</li>
